#INTRODUCTION

Apache CassandraTM and CAP Theorem Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance

• By default, Cassandra is an AP database.
• However, this is tunable with consistency level.
• By tuning consistency level, you can make it more CP than AP.
• However! Cassandra isn’t designed to be CA because you can’t sacrifice partition tolerance.
