#TOOLS FOR MONITORING CASSANDRA

Tools for monitoring cassandra include nodetool,Jconsole and OpsCenter.
All of these tools work by communicating with cassandra through JMX(Java Management Extension).
Through JMX , Cassandra exposes many metrics and commands which any of these tools can use to monitor and manage a cassandra cluster.

#CQL query 
bin/ls

#nodetool<?>
nodetool status
nodetool info 
nodetool ring 
nodetool cfstats
nodetool cfhistograms
nodetool compactionstats

Example:
